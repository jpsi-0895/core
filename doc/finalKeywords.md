# Writing Final classes and Methods

you can declare some or all of a class's methods final. 

Final keywords before methods:
1.  cannot overriden by subclasses.
2.  by final keyword you can manage a variable or object consistent state
3. you can also declare an entire class final. A class that is declared final cannot be suhbclassed.This is particulary usefull, for example, when creating an immutable class like the String class
