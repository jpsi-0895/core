# The execution of code

In Java, the execution of code follows a specific order with distinct stages. Here's a breakdown of the key phases:

1. Class Loading (when the class is first used):

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) encounters a class for the first time (e.g., through the main method).
The JVM searches for the class file (.class) on the classpath.
Once found, the JVM loads the class file's bytecode into memory.
2. Linking and Verification (during class loading):

Linking: The JVM resolves symbolic references (e.g., method calls, field accesses) to their actual definitions in other loaded classes.
Verification: The JVM ensures the bytecode is safe and adheres to Java bytecode specifications to prevent security issues.
3. Initialization (when the class is first used):

Static Initialization Blocks: If the class has static initialization blocks (code blocks marked with static), they are executed in the order they appear in the class definition. This happens only once for the class, even if multiple instances are created.
Constructor: When an object of the class is created, the constructor is invoked. This is where you typically initialize instance variables and perform object setup. Constructors are also called in the order they are defined in the class.
4. Method Execution (throughout program execution):

When a method is called, its bytecode is executed. This includes instance methods (called on objects) and static methods (called on the class itself).
Method execution follows the order of instructions within the method body.
5. Garbage Collection (throughout program execution):

The JVM automatically manages memory and removes objects that are no longer referenced. This happens in the background and doesn't directly affect program execution order.

### Important Points:

- Class loading, linking, and verification typically occur when a class is first used, not necessarily at the start of the entire program.
- Static initialization blocks and constructors are executed only once per class (for static) or per object instance (for constructors).
- Method execution happens whenever a method is called, and the order follows the call sequence.
- Understanding this order is crucial for writing well-structured and predictable Java programs.
