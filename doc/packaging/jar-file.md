# The jar command

The `jar` command is used to create, view, and manipulate JAR (Java Archive) files.

JAR files are used to package Java class files, metadata, and resources into a single archive, making it easier to distribute and deploy Java applications.

### Basic Syntax

```sh
jar [options] [jar-file] [manifest-file] [entry-point] [files...]
```
