# Introduction to DOT NET Framework

In this article, I am going to give you an overview of the DOT NET Framework. This is important for you as a .NET Developer to know the history and evolution of the .NET Framework.

Here, in this article, we will discuss what was there before the `.NET Framework` and what problems we face in that, and how we overcome all those problems in the DOT NET Framework.

## What is COM?

COM stands for `Component Object Model`. The COM is one of Microsoftâ€™s Technologies. Using this technology, we can develop Windows applications as well as Web applications. In COM, `VB` is the programming language that is used to implement Windows applications and ASP is the technology used to implement Web applications.

## What are the disadvantages of COM?

The major two disadvantages of COM are as follows:

- Incomplete object-oriented programming means it will not support all the features of OOPs.
- Platform dependent means COM applications can run on only Windows OS.

> To overcome the above problems, the `DOT NET Framework` comes into the picture.

## What .NET Represents?

NET stands for `Network Enabled Technology`. `In .NET, dot (.) refers to object-oriented and NET refers to the internet`. So the complete .NET means through object-oriented we can implement `internet-based` applications.

A Framework is a `Software`. Or you can say a framework is a collection of many small technologies integrated together to develop applications that can be executed anywhere.

## What is .NET Framework?
